**This project is intended to be used in a UNIX environment**

**How to initialize the server**

./dbserver <port#>

**How to connect a client**

If server is running successfully open a seperate terminal tab and enter:
./dbclient <hostname> <port#>

**I have included the executables dbclient and dbserver if these do not work compile using gcc**
